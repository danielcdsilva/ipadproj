        <div id="stuart_text">I started making records in 2002 at Rec-Age Recorders, learning under the wing of Jesse Gander. Rec-Age was located in the "B" side of Profile Studios in East Van. In 2003 we moved shop to Burnaby and joined forces with The Hive Creative Labs. I enjoyed 8 great years making records there, mostly on the always crazy graveyard shift. Eventually this wore me out, so I turned the bee room at The Hive into Rain City Recorders. From 2008-2010, I operated in the Bee room, then eventually moving the studio closer to home and at its current location in the Mount Pleasant area of Vancouver. </div>
<div id="stuart_text2">I have an honest no bullshit approach to making records. I'm here to make the record that YOU want to make. Whether we are making death metal perfection, or live off the floor crusty hardcore. I'm going to put my heart into capturing every note with your vision in mind. <br>
  <br>
  I have also been mastering records since 2005. Im well versed in both analog gear and the digital world. I have mastered pretty much every genre out there, but most of my mastering credits lie in the Indie Rock, Punk, and Metal genres and all of the the sub genres that lie within. I have the same no bullshit approach to mastering. I'm not here to mangle your mix to death to prove my ultimate super mastering skills. Im here to fix any issues not caught during mixing, and make your record sound the best it possibly can on every playback system. <br>
  <br>
  When I'm not working in the studio, I'm making 90's boom bap beats at home. <br>
